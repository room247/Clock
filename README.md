[![PHPUnit tests](https://github.com/room247/Clock/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/room247/Clock/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

There once has been an implementation of the proposed [PSR-20](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/clock.md) Clock interface already but it has been removed from GitHub for some reason, so I decided to provide an (possibly interim) implementation. Credits go to the former Author.

Since the proposed interface hasn't yet been released by the FIG (and no work has been done to the proposal ever since), you can use this one here.

## Installation

This package is available on [Packagist], so you can install it using [Composer].

```bash
composer require room247/clock
```
